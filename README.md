# archlinux-config
This is my arch-setup script, which I use after installation of Arch linux. 

It configs multilib, installs steam, yay, git, wget, curl, filezilla
With yay it installs visual-studio-code-bin, google-chrome, and after it installs yaru theme (gnome only).
It installs and configs zsh, oh my zsh, zsh highlightning, zsh auto suggestions and in the end it installs telegram.
But you need to open telegram in /opt to make this messenger work correctly.

You can use it by cloning repository, but, easiest way is to use it via sh
